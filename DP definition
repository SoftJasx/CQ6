This solution initializes maxEndingHere and maxSoFar to the first element for the maximum subarray sum, and maxSubsequence is either the first element (if positive) or 0. 
As it iterates through the array, it updates these values based on the current element. 
For arrays with only negative numbers, it ensures the maximum subsequence sum is the largest negative number, addressing the issue of a default zero sum.
